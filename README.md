## NextJS top-loader without any additional libraries

This is a toploader / page transition indicator acting just like the package `nextjs-toploader`, `NProgress` or loading heavy liraries like `framer-motion`. In essence there is nothing wrong with those libraries but it does add another dependency, which is often not necessary _kuch_ lodash _kuch_, or not allowed by the organization. And owning your code is often, not always, better.

It's a easy implementation that involves a custom hook and a gloal state component. This example only shows a basic loader bar but you can let your imagination run wild.

A ✨star✨ is appreciated as that gives me a bigger e-penor.
